# 📊 Statistical Analysis: Chi-Square and ANOVA Tests in Python

This project demonstrates the use of **Chi-Square Test of Independence** and **One-Way ANOVA** to analyze relationships and variance between categorical and continuous variables. The tests are applied on weather-related data to derive statistically significant insights.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform a **Chi-Square Test** to check for relationships between categorical variables
- Conduct a **One-Way ANOVA** to test differences in means across multiple groups
- Interpret statistical results including p-values, test statistics, and visualizations

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📈 Key Analysis

### ✅ Chi-Square Test of Independence

- Compared categorical variables like weather conditions and temperature categories
- Computed Chi-Square statistic and p-value
- Visualized contingency tables and summarized statistical significance

### ✅ One-Way ANOVA

- Evaluated whether mean temperature varies significantly across different weather types
- Calculated F-statistic and p-value
- Verified assumptions and visualized group-wise variance

## 📌 Results

- **Chi-Square Test**: Revealed a strong association between temperature categories and weather conditions.
- **ANOVA**: Confirmed significant variance in temperature distributions across different groups.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Hypothesis testing in academic research
- Feature evaluation in machine learning
- Statistical decision making in data analysis projects

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Run cells sequentially after uploading the dataset or connecting it from your system
3. Review outputs for statistical summaries and charts
